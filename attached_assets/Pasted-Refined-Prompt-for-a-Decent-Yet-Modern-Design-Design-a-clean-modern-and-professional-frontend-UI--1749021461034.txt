Refined Prompt for a Decent Yet Modern Design:
Design a clean, modern, and professional frontend UI for an Office Management System using Next.js and Tailwind CSS.

✅ Modules to Include:

Project Management

Task Management

Employee Management

Income & Expense Tracking

Dashboard Overview

✅ Design Guidelines:

Use minimalist color palettes: soft blue (#E5F0F8), off-white (#F9FAFB), light gray (#E5E7EB), and subtle accents in muted tones (e.g., #A0AEC0 for text).

Avoid overly vibrant colors. Keep contrast subtle and soothing to the eyes.

Use Glassmorphism-inspired cards with light blur and very soft shadows, or flat neumorphic effects.

Include 3D effects subtly — soft shadows, depth layering, card stacking — without overusing them.

Add parallax scrolling sections only where necessary (e.g., dashboard header).

Use modern UI/UX patterns with adequate spacing, card-based sections, and smooth hover states.

Keep animations subtle – use fade-ins, scale-ups, or light motion.

Use a sidebar-based navigation with clean icons and labels.

Stick to system or Google fonts like Inter, Poppins, or DM Sans for professional typography.

✅ Pages to Include:

Dashboard – KPIs, summary charts, notifications in soft widgets.

Projects – List with filter, cards with project stage badges (soft colored).

Tasks – Kanban style or list view with status pills (To Do, In Progress, Done).

Employees – Simple table/list with profile avatars and roles.

Finance – Expense/income summary with clean charts (bar, line, pie).

Settings – Theme toggle (light/dark), profile preferences.

✅ Tech & Structure:

Use Tailwind CSS for styling.

Use recharts or chart.js for lightweight charting with calm color tones.
